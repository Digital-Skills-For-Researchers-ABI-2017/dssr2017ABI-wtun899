# Effects of shear stress on placental vascular formation in Normal and IUGR placenta

### Plaenta is a unique organ that supplies oxygen and nutrients to the growing fetus during pregnancy. Normal development of placental vascularture is crucial for normal development and well-beings of fetus.
### Shear stress has been known to have an effect on functions of vascular endothelial cells from different organs. However, the role of shear stress on placental endothelial cells and formation of new placental vessel (angiogensis) is not clearly understood. 
### My project is to study how placental vascular morphology influences placental blood flow and shear stress and subsequently, how vascular shear stress could affect on placental endothelial cell function. This project will give a better insight into the pathology of intra-uterine growht restriction (IUGR) where placental vascular morphogy is known to be significantly impaired. 

## Motivation
### IUGR is defiend as a fetal birth weight less than 10th percentile of gestational age and about 2% of pregnant mothers are suffering from it . IUGR is associated with numerous medical issues during neonatal life such as cardiovascular and nuerological disorders. Moreover, previous research suggested that IUGR is also associated with Diabetes Mellitus in adult life. 
### It has been proved that the strucutre of placenta blood vessel is different between normal and IUGR preganancy. However, the underlying pathology for this difference as well as the consequeces of this difference are yet to explore. My project is to understand how placental blood flow and shear stress could contriubte to placental vascular development which will possilby help us understand how to prevent and treat IUGR.
