# Effect of shear stress on placental vascular formation in Normal and IUGR placenta

### Plaenta is a unique organ that supplies oxygen and nutrients to the growing baby. Normal development of placental vascularture is crucial for normal development and well-beings of fetus.
### Shear stress has been known to have an affect on functions of vascular endothelial cells from different organs. However, the role of shear stress in formation of new placental vessel (angiogensis) is not clearly understood. 
### My project is to study how placental vascular morphology could affect on placental blood flow and shear stress and subsequently, how vascular shear stress could influence on placental endothelial cell function in terms of placental angiogensis. Understanding role of shear stress in placental angiogensis will give us a better insight into the pathology of intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) which is one of the commonest pregnancy related disorders around the world.   


## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
